# Truthkeeper Systems â€” Proof of Concept

A prototype of a poly-agent epistemic safety framework. Demonstrates how narrow AI agents ("truthkeepers") monitor and constrain recursive drift in self-modifying systems.

## Features
- Drift simulation
- Truthkeeper validation layer
- Arbitration on conflict
- CLI or Streamlit demo

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TannerSt/truthkeeper_app.git
cd documents/truthkeeper_app
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
